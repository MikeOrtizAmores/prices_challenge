### Approach

For the design of the application, scalability has been taken into account, considering the possibility of high
concurrency situations. For this reason, certain decisions have been made in the architecture, such as the use of a
hexagonal architecture with reactive REST services in a potential microservices ecosystem. This approach allows us to
optimize the performance of our application under these circumstances.

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) has not been employed since the example's domain is not rich enough, making it unnecessary
in this context.

With this hexagonal architecture, combined with the use of the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern,
we achieve low coupling with our infrastructure and among the actions that should modify or not the persisted data in
our database.
